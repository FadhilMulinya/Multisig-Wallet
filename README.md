## Project Overview
This project aims to create a user-friendly and functional wallet interface for managing digital assets securely. It consists of two main smart contracts: **WalletFactory** and **Wallet**, which facilitate the creation and management of multi-signature wallets.

## Key Features to Implement
I invite frontend developers to contribute and bring the following features to life:

1. **Create a New Wallet**:
   - Users should be able to create a new wallet with a list of owners.

2. **View Wallets**:
   - Display all wallets for which the logged-in user is marked as an owner.

3. **Initiate Transactions**:
   - Users should be able to initiate a transaction from any wallet they own.

4. **Transaction Signing**:
   - Enable each wallet owner to sign transactions initiated from the wallet.

5. **Broadcast and Execute Transactions**:
   - Allow one of the wallet owners to broadcast and execute the transaction once all required signatures are collected.
